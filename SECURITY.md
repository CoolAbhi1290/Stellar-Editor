# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version alpha, beta, and release versions are supported currently since they're the only ones that are available for usage.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

## Issues

Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/StellarEditor/StellarEditor/issues/new) to **report bugs** or to **make suggestions**. Make sure that you're the first one to report the issue (to avoid duplicates).

## Patches

At the current rate of development, you should be expecting patches for reported issues every month or so. Suggestions, on the other hand, may take from days to a couple of months.
