## What's New

### Parts Explorer

- Overhauled the UI to match the new theme colors
- Temporary removed quick actions
- Added part selection visualization
- Added new controls for part selection
  - <kbd>Click</kbd> = select as only part
  - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Click</kbd> = toggle part selection

### Properties Sidebar

- Added a new sidebar for editing properties to the right
- When parts are selected, they are sorted by type on the right
- Parts with conflicting properties are represented by `~`
- Properties often have units after the number (ex: `100%`, `32m`)
  - Focusing on the property will hide the unit
- Property felids support basic arithmetics (ex: `3 / 2` = `1.5`)
- Some properties have minimum/maximum values (ex: scale x and y have a minimum of 0)
- Some properties translate to a different value in the data structure (ex: `100%` fuel = `1.0`)

### Parts

_‚ùï Only fuel tanks are available for now_

- Removed `shape_text` variants for fuel tanks temporarily
- Added new controls for part selection
  - <kbd>Click</kbd> = select as only part
  - <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Click</kbd> = toggle part selection

### Canvas Controls

- New controls for the canvas have been rewritten from the ground up
- Scroll to pan up and down
- Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to pan on the X-axis
- Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to zoom in and out
- Pinch in and out on a trackpad to zoom in and out proportional to the pinch distance

### Theme

- Stellar now offers new theme colors
- Most of the components now feature a [blurple-ish hue](https://www.google.com/search?q=blurple)
- Colors are now more organized, ranging from darker to lighter (with x-dark/x-light variants)

## Technical Details

### General Note

- Pretty much 100% of the code has been touched in some way

### Part Addresses

- Stellar now utilizes a part address system where an address of a part is an array of numbers (ex: `[4, 3, 8, 1]`)
- Parts now fetch their reactive states through the address
  - We no longer pass down the data through props

### Debug

- Added debug control menu that shows up only in development and alpha builds (planned to be toggleable in settings)

## Known Issues

- None of the buttons inside of `File` in the control many work
- Changing a fuel tank's width overrides its `width_original`, `width_a`, and `width_b`.
- Certain icons can appear smaller than intended
- Selecting parts increases the sensitivity of the canvas controls
