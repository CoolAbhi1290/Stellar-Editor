# Stellar v1.0 Beta 4

It's finally time for a Stellar lift-off using engines added to Stellar in this beta. This beta is jam-packed with optimizations to ensure Stellar does not serve as the bottleneck in your productivity.

## Highlights

_‚ùï This is mostly a technical beta introducing many optimizations and changes to the core engine_

- 4 new engines from the game, including a currently unavailable one in-game!
- A toolbar full of useful utilities that you will need
- Cleaner, faster, and more stable visual part bounds
- Prettier Canvas with even more reliable controls

## What's New

### Engines

_‚ùï `glTF`-based part mesh is currently an experimental feature and is subject to change to maintain parity with the base game_

- Kolibri Engine
  - Meant to be used on small landers
  - Incredibly tiny, `1 x 1.5`
- Valiant Engine
  - Meant to be used in space
  - Very efficient, however, lacking in thrust
  - Medium sized, `1.75 x 2`
- Frontier Engine
  - A large-scale version of the Valiant Engine
  - Quite a chonky boi, `2 x 3.5`
- Peregrine ENgine
  - From the incomplete career mode in Spaceflight Simulator
  - Large, `2 x 2.5`

### Toolbar

![The toolbar features the transform, move, undo, redo, and save buttons](https://i.imgur.com/ycNHqBc.png)

_‚ùï The toolbar is currently incomplete_

- Transform (cursor icon)
  - Used to perform transformations like translations, rotation, and scaling
- Pan
  - Used to pan around the canvas without worrying about accidentally mutating the blueprint
  - Can also be toggled, temporarily, with the <kbd>Space</kbd> key
- Undo
  - Reverts to the last state
  - Is grayed out when there are no changes to be reverted
  - Undo limit, currently, is `512`
- Redo
  - Reverts the undo
  - Redo data will be lost if the blueprint is mutated after an undo
- Save
  - Locally saves the blueprint in Stellar's `.stbp` file format
  - Note that this is different from exporting it to the game; only Stellar understands this format

### Canvas

- The grid is now smaller
  - Major marks at every `1m` (previously, `5m`)
  - Minor marks at every `1/5m` (previously, `1m`)
- The lighting is now closer to the game
  - _‚ùï In-canvas lighting is a temporary feature intended to light up Fuel Tanks; parts should and will be using `MeshBasicMaterial` with a texture moving onwards_

### Translations

- _üéâ You can help translate Stellar over at [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/stellareditor)!_
- Stellar is progressively replacing all interface strings with data-driven path names

### Help Control Menu

- A link for the [Stellar GitHub page](https://github.com/tresabhi/stellar)

## What's Changed

### Canvas

- The maximum zoom has been reduced from `800x` to `200x`
- Rewrote the pan controls to resolve an issue where the canvas acted as if it was only half the original size
  - This also made zooming in a lot more precise

## What's Removed

### Inspect Tab

- Bounding boxes have been removed for now

### Debug Control Menu

- Orbit controls have been removed for now
