# Stellar v1.0 Beta 5

When I tell you this beta is spicy, I imply it's steaming hot in features!

## Highlights

- Rewrote the entire interface from scratch
- A handy create tab
- Easy to use touch controls
- Copy, cut, paste, duplicate, un-group, and more!

## Getting The Beta

Stellar is a PWA Web App and can be found at [stellarbeta.web.app](https://setllarbeta.web.app). Stellar will automatically update to the latest version in the background. Once done, Stellar will prompt you to restart the app.

## üåü What's New

### üñ• User Interface

![a small section of the toolbar with a mouse](https://i.imgur.com/yHVm6DM.png)

- The user interface was re-written from scratch
- The interface uses the **mauve** color palette in combination with **purple** as the accent
- All parts of the interface were made consistent and now share mutual primitives
- All parts of the interface can be navigated with a keyboard
  - Focus outlines are also provided
- The interface is designed mobile-first to ensure it's not cluttered

#### üë©‚Äçüíª Why? Why a Re-write?

Ever since CSS was used to style the app, it was obvious what features it lacked; mainly speaking, CSS does not scale well. SASS did promise a brighter future (which prompted the first interface re-write) but failed to comply with Stellar's needs.

The solution was clear: CSS-in-JS. To be more specific, [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) offered a superior development process and opened up opportunities for theming.

When Spaceflight Simulator added modding support for PC, Stellar was instantly rendered useless. However, Stellar now targets mobile devices which still lack such features. Moreover, Stellar will be able to offer superior editing tools than what's available in-game even with mods.

### ‚ûï Create Tab

- Offers a starting place for new blueprints
- Templates
  - A list of templates is shown on the left side of the screen
  - A search bar can be used to filter through the items
    - This is redundant for now, but, will be useful in the future when there are tons of templates
- File options
  - Available on the rights side of the screen
  - Features options to start from scratch, open a Stellar blueprint file, or an in-game blueprint file
- Status bar
  - The status bar is populated by important information about that version of Stellar

### üî† Rename

![rename popup](https://i.imgur.com/lhQry7h.png)

- Lets you rename multiple parts at once
- Has multiple options to control how each part is named
- Shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>
  - Want to reload instead? Try <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>

### üî† Insert Part

![insert part popup](https://i.imgur.com/pzevLBM.png)

- Lets you quickly insert a part
- `Abstract` means that that part will not be exported to the game; it only exists within the editor and the Stellar file format
- Search through via the search bar to quickly find what you need
- Shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>
  - Want to inspect instead? Try <kbd>F12</kbd>

### Error Screen

![error screen](https://i.imgur.com/SPKfcZm.png)

![debug](https://i.imgur.com/9gLov9T.png)

- Shows up each time Stellar runs into a critical error
- Toggle on debug mode for more nerd info
- It's also mapped for ya :)
- Options
  - Refresh: soft restarts the app; unlikely to fix the error but preserves your unsaved changes to the blueprint
  - Restart: hard restarts the app; likely to fix the error but loses all unsaved data
  - Report: generates a GitHub issue with a click of a button

### ‚òØ Translations

![languages on crowdin](https://i.imgur.com/IUqcfQu.png)

_‚ùï Help translate Stellar on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/stellareditor)!_

- The entire app is translatable
- Not all languages have been translated though...
- The ability to switch between languages will be added in the future in the settings screen

### Performance

- The app now loads twice as fast thanks to react-router's `useNavigator` hook
- The part models are now loaded as the app launches to avoid suspense fallbacks when an engine is inserted

There's just so much more I cannot include here, but that's the main stuff. I'd say that Stellar's about 80% done!
