> **Info** Ever since it was added, it definitely needed more love. Here's the attention that it requires...

![Selection controls](https://i.imgur.com/aSHyKTg.png)

- Selection modification controls
  - "Select Deep" lets you select a part regardless of how deeply buried it is within groups

- Selection controls
  - Added select/unselect all
  - Moved group/ungroup here
- Edit controls
  - Moved the delete, rename, lock, and hide buttons here

- Your device may be eligible for installing Stellar regardless of the notification; read [about PWAs](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)

### Format

- `blueprint.parts` has been changed from `Map<string, Part>` to `Record<string, Part>` because I don't see a point in using a map (the vanilla counterpart being `VanillaPart[]`)
- There are not data fixer uppers to upgrade from blueprint version 5 to 6, so all old `.stbp` files are deprecated
- Most files were switched from `export const foo = () => { ... }` to `export default function foo() { ... }` to closely stick to airbnb styling guides
  - A lot of files still need this change
- Most core functions were renamed to be less verbose
  - They're no longer all exported from `core/*/index.ts` as they manage their own default exports now
- All primitive `Foo.Container` were renamed to `Foo.Root` to match Radix UI

We moved technologies from Webpack to Vite, did a bunch of other fancy code stuff, and a million others things that I either forgot to mention here or are too "code-oriented" to be intreating; but, none of that matters. We have a great beta at hand! Let's see what the future holds.
