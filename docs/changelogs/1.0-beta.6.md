## Getting The Beta

Stellar is a PWA Web App and can be found at [stellarbeta.web.app](https://setllarbeta.web.app). Stellar will automatically update to the latest version in the background. Once done, Stellar will prompt you to restart the app.

## What's New

### Create Screen Rework

  - Soon, they will represent whether they were outsourced
  - Join [our discord server](https://discord.gg/nDt7AjGJQH) and submit your templates!
- Added the Stellar logo near the name and motto
- Fixed spacing between the word "Stellar" and the version number in the status bar

### Toolbar

> **Info** Ever since it was added, it definitely needed more love. Here's the attention that it requires...

![Selection controls](https://i.imgur.com/aSHyKTg.png)

- Selection modification controls
  - "Select Deep" lets you select a part regardless of how deeply buried it is within groups
  - "Select Multiple" enables you to bypass the concurrency of selection
  - "Focus Mode" toggles the new Focus Mode, which lets you... well... focus (with better screen space management)
- Selection controls
  - Added select/unselect all
  - Moved group/ungroup here
- Edit controls
  - Moved the delete, rename, lock, and hide buttons here
- Clipboard controls remain the same
  - Only the copy icon was tweaked
- The info options were changed from a circled question mark icon to a circled info icon
  - The function essential controls were also finally fully implemented (my bad, lol)
- Settings were enabled

### Settings

    - This was, again, implemented in Beta 5 but has now been exposed

- Lets you know that Stellar can indeed be installed
- Your device may be eligible for installing Stellar regardless of the notification; read [about PWAs](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)

### Format

- `blueprint.parts` have been changed from `Map<string, Part>` to `Record<string, Part>` because I don't see a point in using a map (the vanilla counterpart being `VanillaPart[]`)
- There are no data fixer uppers to upgrade from blueprint version 5 to 6, so all old `.stbp` files are deprecated
- Most files were switched from `export const foo = () => { ... }` to `export default function foo() { ... }` to closely stick to Airbnb styling guides
  - A lot of files still need this change
- Most core functions were renamed to be less verbose
  - They're no longer all exported from `core/*/index.ts` as they manage their own default exports now
- All primitive `Foo.Container` were renamed to `Foo.Root` to match Radix UI

We moved technologies from Webpack to Vite, did a bunch of other fancy code stuff, and a million others things that I either forgot to mention here or are too "code-oriented" to be intreating, but none of that matters. We have a great beta at hand! Let's see what the future holds.
