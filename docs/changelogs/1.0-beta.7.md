## Getting The Beta

### Reference Images

![Image upload options](https://i.imgur.com/inAjAV9.png)

- Allows you to add images for reference and templating
- Choose between adding a URL or uploading an image
  - URLs are preffered as they help keep the file size down
    - However, some website may not allow Stellar to fetch those images
    - Such images fail to load
  - Images can be uploaded
    - This embeds the image inside the blueprint file which does increase its file size!
- Don't forget to lock the reference image to avoid accidentally mutating it

### Toolbar

![The new toolbar layout](https://i.imgur.com/c9dwm5T.png)

![New increment settings](https://i.imgur.com/YloKMt7.png)

- Rearranged the toolbar once again
- Added increment settings
  - Snap to grid
    - Snaps translations every `0.2m`
    - Snaps rotation every `15째`
  - No snap
    - Does not implement any sort of snapping
  - Scale with ratio
    - Scales parts while maintaining the `x` and `y` ratio

### Translations

| Before                               | After                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |

- Simplified explainations
- Implemented [Microsoft's capitalization guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/capitalization)

### Quick Controls

![All the quick controls](https://i.imgur.com/lfPpMEV.png)

- Quick controls allow you to... control quickly!
- Rotate left: rotates `+90째`
- Rotate right: rotates `-90째`
- Mirror horizontally
- Mirror vertically

### Transformation Controls

| Before                               | After                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| ![](https://i.imgur.com/jb5pR2b.png) | ![](https://i.imgur.com/UZ1iSic.png) |

- The scaling transformation controls were rewritten from scratch
  - Should be more performance friendly (I haven't checked)
  - Parts cardinal to one another now are bounded correctly
  - Parts cadinal to one another now also scale properly
- Added the rotation node
  - Lets you rotate parts off their center

### Fuel Tanks

| Before                                        | After                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ![](https://i.imgur.com/XMsclmT.png)          | ![](https://i.imgur.com/GrPFRJo.png)          |
| (in-game)![](https://i.imgur.com/vxoC9Cg.png) | (in-game)![](https://i.imgur.com/xIJ2qE6.png) |

- Fuel tanks now look closer to that in-game
- Fuel tanks now also export with a "cap" if needed to maintain a shape where the top and bottom with aren't the same

### Progress Loss Confirmation

![The prompt](https://i.imgur.com/pZhQvf7.png)
![The native prompt](https://i.imgur.com/OTL3gDa.png)

- Asks you before wiping any unsaved changes

### Selection Box

![Selection boxes](https://i.imgur.com/oamhnq8.gif)

- Quickly select parts within the bounds of the selection
- Unlike the game, you don't have to hold down on the screen for a bit before dragging to select parts

### Edit Mode

![The mode in action](https://i.imgur.com/M9CqFJt.gif)

- Edit mode lets you perform special operations on a single part at a time
- The fuel tank is the only part currently with an edit mode
  - Change the bottom width, top width, and height visually

### Lighting

| Before                               | After                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| ![](https://i.imgur.com/87FgHRi.png) | ![](https://i.imgur.com/oLUHDWG.png) |

- The fuel tank was the last part that used physical lighting
- Since that is no longer the case, I've implemented lighting correcting for consistent builds
- This flips parts that are rotated more than `180째` or are flipped on the `x` axis

### Export Tab

![The export tab](https://i.imgur.com/k43VWGI.png)

- Provides quick options to export the current file
- Options
  - Format emitted files: formats the `JSON` using JavaScript's built-in API
  - Watermark exported blueprints: added a `"Generated by Stellar": "https://stellaralpha.web.app/"` at the begenning of files
- Export
  - Export to game: emits a `.txt` file in SFS format
  - Save Stellar format: emits a `.stbp` or `.json` file in Stellar format

### Shortcuts

- Insert part: changed to `I`
- Rename: changed to `F2`

I've said this a million times and I'm gonna say it again. I've made thousands of little changes, bug fixes, and probably even more features that I have simply forgotten that I've not mentioned in the changelog. I really appriciate everyone's patience as I brew Stellar into the app that it deserves to be. Thank you!
